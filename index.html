            <h3 class="future_path">Why am I interested in a career in programming?</h3>
            <p>Although with very little knowledge of coding and programming,<br>slowly and gradually as I study and learn to code: 
            I knew that this is what I want to do for a career.<br>In the past month that I have dedicated most of my time to study to code
            <br>it has given me a different environment where I was being able to fully enjoy my time on the laptop.<br>
            There were so many difficult puzzles,challenges and trials I had to get through to be able to start my own portfollio.<br>
            Now I can safely say that I am extremely intrigue to see how farI can further knowledge in this field.</p>

            <h3 class="my_hobby">How my interests in coding began.</h3>
            <p>There are many different hobbies I enjoyed doing on a day-to-day basis<br> but there are also some that I enjoy doing over a 
            course of time.<br>One hobby that I have always loved was solving a puzzle,<br>it can be anything as long as I get an 
            instructions or some knowledge about how to solve them.<br>I think having that feeling of satisfaction after solving a puzzle always 
            feel amazing<br>no matter how small they may be.<br>I also think that my interest in coding mostly stems from this hobby<br>as I have
            always enjoyed racking my brain trying to understand or working on something.</p>
